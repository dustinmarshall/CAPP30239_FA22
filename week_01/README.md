Hi! My name is Dustin Marshall. Before coming to U Chicago, I worked at a research center that at UC Berkeley that ran randomized controlled trials on poverty interventions in low- and middle-income countries. I'm currently co-leading the International Development Policy Association (IDPA) and am a research assistant at the Development Innovation Lab (DIL). After MSCAPP, I'd still like to work on poverty interventions, but as a data scientist.
