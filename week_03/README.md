## Week 3

Tuesday we will discuss three data visualization theorists: Stephen Few, Edward Tufte, and Alberto Cairo. We will take a look at some of their ideas and discuss Data Art vs Data Visualization in detail.

Thursday we will dive into D3js.

Data source: Title, Agency, Location, Link
Anonymized data from Working Paper, “Testing Personalized Online Messaging Interventions to Increase COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance in Kenya and Nigeria,” by Leah R. Rosenzweig and Molly Offer-Westort.

Description of data:
Data on vaccine intentions pre- and post-intervention from an an online experimental evaluation among 22,014 social media users in Kenya and Nigeria, aggregated by country, subdivision, age, gender, digital literacy, scientific knowledge, country, access to health services, political partisanship, religion, and religiosity.

Why you are interested in this topic:
I currently support this research as a research assistant for the Development Innovation Lab (DIL), where we assess the impact of intervention on poverty and global health in low- and middle-income countries.

Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data:
I hope to be able to disaggregate the effects of the intervention across all of the aformentioned covariates, as well as build on the findings by integrating them with additional public health and demographic data sets.

Potential data points:
Effect size by county, by age, by gender, by digital literacy, etc.

Any concerns about the data:
As I mentioned in my email (through Canvas), since the paper is still a working paper, the anonymized replication data has yet to be released (so it's not technically public). That said, I've received confirmation from the two co-authors that I can still post the visualization publicly, as long as the figures are limited to aggregated data (by county, age, etc). 

Identify if source is primary or secondary:
Primary (I will try to integrate secondary data as well).
