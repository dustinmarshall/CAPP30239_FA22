        <h1># Deaths by Police, Grouped by Month (US, 2015)</h1>
        <p>
            By looking at the total number of deaths by police, grouped by month, we are able to get an overall sense of the toll that police violence takes and whether it varies by month. The data used in this histogram comes from <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_06/a3cleanedonly2015.json">The Washington Post</a>.

        <h1>% Deaths by Police Where Suspect is Mentally Ill, Grouped by State (US, 2015)</h1>
        <p>
            By looking at the percentage of deaths by police where the suspect is mentally ill, grouped by State, we are able to (in the same way that we were above) draw connections between state-by-state differences and how they might effect these statistics. This analysis could benefit from additional information regarding how state laws dictate the ways in which police are expected to interact with mentally ill suspects. The data used in this histogram comes from <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_06/a3cleanedonly2015.json">The Washington Post</a>.

        <h1>% Deaths by Police by Race (US, 2015)</h1>
        <p>
            By looking at the percentage of deaths by police, grouped by race, we are able to see how disproporionately some races are represented in police data, especially deaths. This analysis could benefit from additional data on national population percentages by race, to give us a better understanding of how disproportionate the representation actually is.
